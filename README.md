# Microvacbot
This project aims to develop an open-source educational robot, thus it can be programmed in different ways. For example, remotely through its wifi module (using Scratch or Python), or with the [MicrovacApp](https://github.com/dpm76/MicrovacApp) (the Android application) for basic remote controlling intended for beginners, or even, it could be internally programmed by advanced programmers to perform customized automatic tasks.
